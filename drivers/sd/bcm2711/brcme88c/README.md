# Standard SD Host Controller Miniport

This is a sample for a Secure Digital (SD) Host Controller miniport driver. The driver works in conjunction with sdport.sys, which implements SD/SDIO/eMMC protocol and WDM interfaces, to provide the host register interface.

## Universal Compliant

This sample builds a Windows Universal driver. It uses only APIs and DDIs that are included in Windows Core.

This driver, sdhc.sys, provides a functional miniport implementation for a standard SD host controller. 

However, it does not have support for many more recent features such as:

- UHS-I speed modes.

- HS400

- SD 4.0
